# CarGeneratorWPL

The script allows you to create a [parked car generator](https://gtamods.com/wiki/CARS_(IPL_Section)) for a [WPL](https://gtamods.com/wiki/WPL#Section_3_-_CARS) format file.

Usage: While in the car, press Y to save the string for WPL to a text file.

The script has two versions - for [CLEO Redux](https://github.com/cleolibrary/CLEO-Redux) and [IVSDKDotNet](https://github.com/ClonkAndre/IV-SDK-DotNet).
